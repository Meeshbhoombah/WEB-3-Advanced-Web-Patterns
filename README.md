## Course Overview

We've learned a lot about the web; the common conventions and we've mastered authentication 
and authorization. Now pretty much you can sort through whatever someone asked for. However, 
what differentiates hackers and engineers is engineers understand what are going on under the hood 
of the mere conventions and tools. Engineers can also build their own tools.

In this course we will go explore SQL and relational databases, look at some common advanced web 
functionality, and then go under the hood in Node.js and npm.

We'll be doing projects in ES5 and ES6 - the newest version of JavaScript that is 
still being adopted.
