# Success & Error Handling

## Competencies

* Handle errors effectively in Express.js
* Put in custom 404 and 500 pages in production
* Display flash messages to keep users informed about errors and successes.

## Background

Apps don't always work! Actually they often break, and when they do we should have built them the degrade elegantly and keep the user (or the developer) informed as to what is happening.

We're going to look at a few common patterns of error handling and how to implement them in Node.js with Express.js.

## Success & Error "Flash" Messages

Whenever you succeed or fail at creating, updating, or deleting anything, it is best practice to notify the user. To do this we use an object sent with a response called `flash`.

For alternative implementations of flash messages in express read [this lovely article](https://gist.github.com/brianmacarthur/a4e3e0093d368aa8e423).

We're going to use the npm library [express-flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-flash) to handle flashes. Flash messages typically require cookies and sessions in order to keep track of the state of the flash message.

```js
  // server.js
  var flash = require('express-flash'),
      express = require('express'),
      app = express();

  app.use(express.cookieParser('keyboard cat'));
  app.use(express.session({ cookie: { maxAge: 60000 }}));
  app.use(flash());

  // controller.js
  app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    req.flash('info', 'Welcome');
    res.render('index', {
      title: 'Home'
    })
  });

  // main.hanldebars template
  {{#if messages.info}}
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <span>{{messages.info}}</span>
  </div>
  {{/if}}
```

### Flash Challenge

1. Add `express-flash` and display success and error messages in your sql-blog or client project.

## Express Error Handling

When something fails to work, like a validation or something, then using a flash message to notify the user that something went wrong is a good solution. But what about when your app fully crashes? Express has its own error handling pattern. You can tell Express error handler middleware because it has 4 arguments. e.g.

```js
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
  // logging and other
  // error handling code
});
```

As we'll see you use the `next(err)` command to trigger the error middleware within a request.

In those cases you can use express's standard error handling pattern to present a custom 500 or 404 page.

A famous custom 404 page is the github 404 page. e.g. [https://github.com/imabooger](https://github.com/imabooger). Where else have you seen custom 404 or 500 pages? How would you add an easter-egg page like the GitHub one to your own site?

## Challenges - Custom 404 and 500 pages

Because we don't want to assume that the app can even render a template, we can actually keep our custom `500.html` template in our public file and serve it as a static template.

The standard Express.js error handler code is below, but we're going to start off simpler:


1. Add the code below to add a Not Found error that runs only if no other endpoint is triggered.

  ```js
  // server.js
  
  app.use(function(req, res, next) {
    var err = new Error('Not Found');
    err.status = 404;
    next(err);
  });

  app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
    if(err.status == 404) {
    //do logging and user-friendly error message display
      res.redirect('/404.html');
    } else if (err.status == 500) {
      res.redirect('/500.html');
    }
  });
  ```

1. Now add the `404.html` template to your `public` folder. Remeber this template cannot inherit from your layout template because it is being served statically.

1. Now that that's done let's look at the standard Express.js error middleware code to extend ours more. It has all the same sort of stuff, but it adds a check to see if you are in production or not. If in development, it just displays the error, but in production it hides the stack trace. Let's add this check for development enviornment.

```js
// server.js
// catch 404 and forward to error handler

app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  var err = new Error('Not Found');
  err.status = 404;
  next(err);
});

// IF DEVELOPMENT
if (app.get('env') === 'development') {
  app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
    res.status(err.status || 500);
    res.render('error', {
      message: err.message,
      error: err
    });
  });
} else { // IF PRODUCTION
  // production error handler
  // no stacktraces leaked to user
  app.use(function(err, req, res, next) {
    res.status(err.status || 500);
    res.render('error', {
      message: err.message,
      error: {}
    });
  });
}
```

Great work! How cool can you make your 404.html template. Finish it and share it in slack in the `web-3` channel.
